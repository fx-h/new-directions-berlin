# Course Description {#sec-description}

This workshop is designed to introduce some recent developments in causal inference, selected in consultation with DYNAMICS Ph.D. students. The first module exposes students to techniques from data science and statistical learning and their application in causal inference problems. The second module considers the concept of sensitivity from several different perspectives. The third module introduces important new approaches to and understandings about the well-known difference-in-differences design.

# Prerequisites 

Students should be familiar with the rudiments of the potential outcomes model for causal inference, as well as topics in introductory statistics such as null hypothesis significance tests, confidence intervals, and linear regression. Students should be familiar with analyzing data with code, preferably in R or Python. It will be helpful if students have background in techniques for causal inference from experiments and observational data, but we will strive to build ideas from the ground up. Students without familiarity or experience in these topics are also welcome.
